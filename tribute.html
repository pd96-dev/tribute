                Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai (12 August 1919 – 30 December 1971) was an Indian physicist and astronomer who
                initiated space research and helped develop nuclear power in India. He was honoured with Padma Bhushan
                in 1966 and the Padma Vibhushan (posthumously) in 1972. He is internationally regarded as the Father of
                the Indian Space Program.

                About the Legend
            </h1><br>
            <p>Son of Ambalal Sarabhai, he came from the famous Sarabhai family from India who were major industrialists
                committed to the Indian independence movement. Vikram Sarabhai married the classical dancer Mrinalini in
                1942. The couple had two children. His daughter Mallika gained prominence as an actress and activist,
                and his son Kartikeya too became an active person in science. During his lifetime, he practiced Jainism.
                He attended Gujarat College, Ahmedabad, but later moved to the University of Cambridge, England, where
                he took his tripos in natural sciences in 1940. In 1945 he returned to Cambridge to pursue PhD and wrote
                a thesis, “Cosmic Ray Investigations in Tropical Latitudes,” in 1947<a href="#num">[1]</a>.<br>Known as the cradle of space
                sciences in India, the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) was founded in 1947 by Vikram Sarabhai. PRL
                had a modest beginning at his residence, the "RETREAT", with research on cosmic rays. The institute was
                formally established at the M.G. Science Institute, Ahmedabad, on 11 November 1947 with support from the
                Karmkshetra Educational Foundation and the Ahmedabad Education Society. Prof. Kalpathi Ramakrishna
                Ramanathan was the first Director of the institute. The initial focus was research on cosmic rays and
                the properties of the upper atmosphere. Research areas were expanded to include theoretical physics and
                radio physics later with grants from the Atomic Energy Commission. He led the Sarabhai family-owned
                business conglomerate.</p><br>
